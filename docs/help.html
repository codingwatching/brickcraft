    <h3 id="wrong-uvs">Set correct uvs on terrain mesh</h3>

    <p>Terrain is using a single texture:</p>
    <p><img src="https://github.com/tetreum/brickcraft/raw/main/Assets/Resources/Textures/Terrain.png"></p>

    <p>But i don't now how to set the uvs in order to use it properly.<br>
    If i set all vertices, the entire texture is used, which is not what i'm looking for:

    <p>With my latest attempt it looks like</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/UZJQpQu.png">
    <p>Each face has only 1 color => good. But it's not the same color across all faces and also it's always the wrong color => fail.</p>

    <p>Here is the code that handles uvs setup: <a href="https://github.com/tetreum/brickcraft/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/World/ChunkRenderer.cs#L546" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ChunkRenderer.cs#L546</a>

    <h3 id="broken-terrain-mesh">Terrain mesh is randomly broken because of brick's top face</h3>
    <p>FIXED BY <a href="https://github.com/stone-SJH" rel="nofollow">stone-SJH</a> on <a href="https://github.com/tetreum/brickcraft/pull/2" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/tetreum/brickcraft/pull/2</a> <br>
    Turns out model wasn't the problem. It was about meshes with huge vertices count. That's why it seemed "random".
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to generate the terrain mesh, i grab the brick model and i use planes to delimitate each face.
    </p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XuwjStb.png">
    <p>Notice the blue planes "cutting" each face.</p>
    <p>Then i use a <a href="https://github.com/tetreum/brickcraft/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Utils/FaceMapper.cs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">small class</a> that iterates over all brick mesh's vertices to know to which face do they belong.</p>
    <p>
        After that, when building a mesh slice, i just add the visible brick faces of each case at
        <a href="https://github.com/tetreum/brickcraft/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/World/ChunkRenderer.cs#L495" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ChunkRenderer.cs#L495</a>
    </p>

    <p>If top face is properly cut:</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/XuwjStb.png">

    <p>Then it randomly breaks:</p>

    <p>If only studs are set as top face:</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/s0gMxMJ.png">

    <p>It doesn't break:</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NGUxIuA.png">

    <p>
        Notice how all other faces are also rendering properly now. Yet they haven't been edited.
    </p>
    <p></p>
        How the heck can they "randomly" break?<br>
        If vertices that are used both in top and lateral faces are the problem, why do they not always break?<br>
        What am i missing out?......<br>
